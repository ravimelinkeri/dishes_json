            " Heat ghee or oil in a large pan and add cumin seeds. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, cooking until the raw smell disappears. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until the oil starts separating.  Add the marinated chicken and cook for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and tender. ",
            "In a large heavy-bottomed pot, start layering the chicken and rice. Spread half of the chicken mixture at the bottom, followed by a layer of rice. Sprinkle mint leaves, coriander leaves, saffron milk, and fried onions. Repeat with the remaining chicken and rice. Finish with a final layer of rice, saffron milk, mint, coriander, and fried onions.
