                "In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, ground coriander, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt.  Add the mutton pieces, coat well, and marinate for at least 1-2 hours (preferably overnight). ",
                "Heat ghee or oil in a pressure cooker or heavy-bottomed pan. Add cumin seeds and let them crackle. Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, cooking until the raw smell disappears. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until the oil starts separating from the mixture. Add the marinated mutton and cook on medium heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water and pressure cook for 20-25 minutes until the mutton is tender. If using a regular pan, cook for 45-60 minutes until the meat is soft. ",
                " In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add cloves, cardamom, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until 70% done (the rice should still have a bite). Drain and set aside.",
                "In a large heavy-bottomed pot, start layering the cooked mutton and rice.
